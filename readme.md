##why?

If you play games or run fullscreen openGL software on linux in a different resolution than the native one, you find your self forced to use openGl's resolution when you are in desktop which can be frustrating if your games are on a lower resolution.

##how it works:

> git clone https://github.com/cryptic-jsdev/linux-OpenGL-resolution-changer
> cd linux-OpenGL-resolution-changer
> npm install
> node index
